* I've pushed fine-tuned [ConvNext](https://huggingface.co/dfurman/ConvNext-base-chesapeake-land-cover-v0) and [BEiT](https://huggingface.co/dfurman/BEiT-base-chesapeake-land-cover-v0) models to Hugging Face for hosted inference. At these links, one can test the generalizability of the models by loading in images and/or playing with the default examples of out-of-domain data that I've configured within.
